If you would like to contribute, please see our [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

## Working on the layer

Your layer is at the root of this repository, it is exactly like a regular Nuxt project, except you can publish it on NPM.

The `.playground` directory should help you on trying your layer during development.

Running `pnpm dev` will prepare and boot `.playground` directory, which imports your layer itself.

## Distributing the layer

Your Nuxt layer is shaped exactly the same as any other Nuxt project, except you can publish it on NPM.

To do so, you only have to check if `files` in `package.json` are [valid](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers#npm-package), then run:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Alternatively, you can run:

```bash
pnpm run publish <version>
```

Where `<version>` is either `patch`, `minor` or `major`. This will take care of `package.json` and update the version number for you, as well as publish to npm.

Once published, users can install the layer with:

```bash
npm install --save @sbc-connect/nuxt-core-layer
```

Then add the dependency to their `extends` in `nuxt.config`:

```ts
defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: '@sbc-connect/nuxt-core-layer'
})
```
